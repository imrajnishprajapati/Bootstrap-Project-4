            <h5>On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched Chandrayaan 2 spacecraft into an earth orbit as part of the second
                lunar mission. Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk -III) is a three-stage
                launch vehicle, which carried the spacecraft, comprised of the Orbiter, the Lander Vikram and the
                Rover Pragyan. The Pragyan Rover was placed strategically among the imperative areas of GSLV Mk-III
                and carried some key responsibilities/functionalities. The rover is a six-wheeled robotic vehicle
                and is capable of conduct in-situ payload experiments. It is powered by AI tools and frameworks,
                uses solar energy for its functioning and can communicate only with the Lander. The Pragyan Rover
                payloads consist of Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown
                Spectroscope (LIBS).</h5>

            <h2>Structural health monitoring through classification of strain patterns using artificial neural
                network</h2>
            <h4>Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
                Space <br>

                In November 2018, ISRO published a compendium for preparing project proposals by universities, which
                mentioned about programs and research areas in space such as launch vehicle, satellite
                communication, earth observations, space sciences, and meteorology. The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre
                (VSSC) introduced structural health monitoring technology through classification of strain patterns
                using artificial neural network (ANN). The technology increases safety and reduces maintenance costs
                of high-performance composite structures used in aircraft and re-entry vehicles. ANN helps in
                detection of damages such as fibre failure, matrix cracking, de-laminations, skin-stiffener de-bonds
                in composite structures. It is used by ISRO to classify sensor malfunctioning and structural
                failures based on strain patterns of healthy and unhealthy structures. ISRO demanded an analytical
                study for the adopted methodology in its compendium.</h4>
            <h2>Focus on geospatial technology-based services </h2>
            <h4>Geospatial Mapping <br>
                Space <br>
                Remote Sensing <br>

                In June 2018, Antrix Corporation (the commercial arm of ISRO) and SatSure Analytics (a satellite
                data analytics company which uses big data and machine learning technologies) signed an MoU to
                increase the penetration of geospatial technology-based services and to develop analytics products
                in various sectors such as agriculture, banking and financial services, social infrastructure,
                energy, and telecommunications. The partnership aims to develop synergies through technical advisory
                services, joint project execution, and national capacity building in the geospatial data analytical
                industry in India. It will also form a framework for effective collaboration with national space
                program and new home-grown startups with big data, machine learning, satellite imagery, and remote
                sensing capabilities.</h4>
            <h2>AI-enabled monitoring system for forest conservation</h2>
            <h4>Remote Sensing <br>
                Forest Conservation <br>
                ISRO <br>

                The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), which ISRO has designed and developed, is a monitoring
                system to observe forest cover change and combat deforestation by leveraging optical remote sensing,
                geographic information system, AI, and automation technologies. The monitoring system allows experts
                to detect small-scale deforestation and improve the frequency of reporting. It also enables
                scientists to process satellite imagery faster and reduces the time frame for new reports from one
                year to one month. NSRC aims at preventing negative changes in the green cover and protection of
                wildlife. The NRSC technology makes it possible for monitoring forest cover changes over small areas
                of one hectare by improving the resolution from 50 meters to 30 meters through optical remote
                sensing which provides insights into the smallest of deforestation activity. </h4>

            <h2>Gateway to Indian earth observation</h2>
            <h4>Forest Conservation <br>
                Geospatial Mapping <br>

                ISRO launched an open data archive geo-portal called ‘Bhuvan,’ which provides visualization services
                and earth observation data to users in public domain, and offers remote sensing applications. The
                portal uses a crowdsourcing approach for collecting point-of-interest data and acts as a platform to
                host government data such as of the forest departments. It allows users to explore 2D and 3D
                representation of the surface of the earth, pest surveillance, disaster services, high-resolution
                imagery of cities, etc. States like Punjab, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh use
                Bhuvan for specific applications in forestry, tourism, municipal, GIS, geo-tagging, etc.



                The geo-portal is now enriched with 20 ministry portals and 30 state portals and assists government
                programs such as Integrated Watershed Development Program (Srishti-Drishti), National Mission for
                Clean Ganga, AMRUT, etc. The portal also enables latest tools and techniques such as data discovery,
                metadata display, database creation and maintenance, smart city programs, and surveillance and
                monitoring systems.</h4>
            <h2>Other Details</h2>
            <p>ISRO has advised scientists and researchers to focus on building a generalized parameter extraction
                software based on artificial neural network (ANN) learning methods which utilizes multidimensional
                approximation of ANN to map characteristics of microwave filters. A communication satellite contains
                large number of microwave filters which are required to undergo extensive tuning after fabrication.
                The generalized parameter extraction software is installed on network analyzer and provides
                real-time equivalent circuit parameters. The department can also use the software for sequential
                characterization of filtering coupling values. Read more

                ISRO is currently planning to develop high-end propulsion technology to ensure cost effective
                re-usable, recoverable, re-startable and reliable space launches with AI-based sensors equipped in
                propellants. Read more
